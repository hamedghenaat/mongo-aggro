# Commit Style Guidance

All commit messages must use the prescribed types (`feat`, `ref`, `doc`, `ci`, `cd`, `dep`, `style`, `fix`) and follow Conventional Commits. The first line must describe all actions in ≤50 characters, be a single sentence that explains everything that changed, and be followed by an empty line and detail lines that start with `-` describing each change. If referencing a specific Sentry or GitHub issue with a unique code, include it as `(type #code: ...)`, e.g., `(fix #gh45: use x instead of y)`.
